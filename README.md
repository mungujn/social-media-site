# Python Django Social Media Website

Built this back in the day to help me practice my python skills. I choose to build a social media site because it would need a lot of the functionality found in most web sites and web applications; registration (form handling), user authentication, file uploads, database CRUD operations etc.

I modified this great ecommerce template from [Bootstrapious](https://bootstrapious.com/p/obaju-e-commerce-template "Template's Homepage") and turned it (well parts of it) into a social media site.

Some philosophical point could probably be made about the uncanny similarity between websites where we sell stuff and how our social media sites are structured. Or it could just be that good design patterns tend to produce relatively similar sites. Who knows.

Anyway I recommend some familiarity with django incase you want to use this code. [The official django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/ "Writing your first Django app") is pretty good.

If you havent yet made up your mind as to whether or not to use django, take a while and look at other options.
